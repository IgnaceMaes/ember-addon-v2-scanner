# Dependency Maintainers

(aka `depmain`)

## Who maintains your project?

This tool recurses through your project's `node_modules` and gathers the maintainers, people with publish access on npm, and lists them out with a total of how many projects you use that they have access to.

For example:

```bash
$ npx dependency-maintainers@latest



```
